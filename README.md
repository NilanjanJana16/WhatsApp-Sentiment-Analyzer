# WHATSAPP CHAT & SENTIMENT ANALYZER



WhatsApp-Analyzer is a statistical analysis tool for WhatsApp chats. Working on the chat files that can be exported from WhatsApp it generates various plots showing, for example, which another participant a user responds to the most. We propose to employ dataset manipulation techniques to have a better understanding of WhatsApp chat present in our phones. This also shows the sentiment of the group as whole and has drop down to select the analysis for a particular user in the group.

### Overview-
#
The initial part of the project is to understand implementation and usage of various python- built modules. These various modules provide better code representation and user understandability. The following libraries are used such as numpy, scipy pandas, csv, sklearn, matplotlib, sys, re, emoji, nltk seaborn etc. this analysis proves to be better input to machine learning models which essentially explore the chat data. These models require proper learning instances which provides better accuracy for these models. Our project ensures to provide an in-depth exploratory data analysis on various types of WhatsApp chats.

### Dataset- 
#
    1. The first step is Data Retrieval & Preprocessing, that is to gather the data. WhatsApp allows you to export your chats through a .txt format.

    4. I will be Exporting Without Media.
        NOTE:
        Without media: exports about **40k messages **
        With media: exports about 10k messages along with pictures/videos
        While exporting data, avoid including media files because if the number of media files is greater than certain figure then not all the media files are exported.
